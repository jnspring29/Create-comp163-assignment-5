#Why you chose each loop type for each challenge
I chose each type by determining what information that I had to make my code run smoothly (if I had no info while was used and I used for when I had the info)
#How your solutions work
for the first test case how my solution works is to allow the users to input their numbers and be able to get the sequences (with the spaces and counts). for the second test case the user can use any positive interger to determine if it's (the input) a prime number. the 3rd test case is similar in making the multiplication table.
#Any AI assistance used
I used AI to help me debug my code when I could not find the error myself
